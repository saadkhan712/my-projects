## Issues I'm Facing

I’m encountering some issues with the project that I could use some help resolving:

 **Score calculation errors**:
   - The score doesn’t always update correctly after answering questions, either skipping updates or giving incorrect results.
   - I’ve checked the logic in my score function, but I’m still having trouble identifying the problem.

## How You Can Help
If you’ve encountered similar issues or have experience with building quiz apps, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Specific areas where help would be most valuable:
- Fixing the timer logic
- Correcting the score update mechanism
- Improving stability to prevent app crashes when users navigate quickly
